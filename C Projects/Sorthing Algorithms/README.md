# Sorting Algorithms Program
The purpose of this code is to implement sorting functions that are used through computer science. These include the bubble sort, quick sort with a stack, and quick sort with a queue. Along with implementing these sorts, I also implemented queues and stacks.

## Build

        $ Typing "make" will build it.
        $ Typing "format" will format it.
        $ Typing "clean" will remove the binaries

## Running

        $ ./sorting along with any of the command line options will run the program.
        $ ./sorting -a will run all of the sorting algorithms.
        $ ./sorting -b will run the bubble sort.
        $ ./sorting -q will run the quick sort with a stack.
        $ ./sorting -Q will run the quick sort with a queue.
        $ ./sorting -n will allow user to input number of elements to sort.
        $ ./sorting -r will allow user to input random seed.
        $ ./sorting -p will allow user to input number of elements to print.
        $ ./sorting -h will print all options available.
