# Random Function Program

The purpose of this code is to implement a game called Left, Right, and Center in which a specified number of players with $3 each will roll a dice that will decide to give money to the person on the right or left, pot in the center, or nothing. Eventually 1 player will win and gain all the money in the pot. This will be implemented with the random function as well as several loops and input code.

## Build

        $ Typing "make" or "make all" will build it.
        $ Typing "clean" will remove the binaries.

## Running

        $ ./lrc will prompt the person to input a random seed number and the number of players at which point the program will run on its own to completion.
